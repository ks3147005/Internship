<h1 class="hippo">The hippopotamus </h1>
<p>Also called the hippo, common hippopotamus, or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis). Its name comes from the ancient Greek for "river horse" .
    Aside from elephants and rhinos, the hippopotamus is the largest land mammal. It is also the largest extant land artiodactyl. Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, the closest living relatives of the hippopotamids are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc.), from which they diverged about 55 million years ago. Hippos are recognisable for their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths with large canine tusks, nearly hairless bodies, pillar-like legs, and large size: adults average 1,500 kg (3,310 lb) for bulls (males) and 1,300 kg (2,870 lb) for cows (females). Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running 30 km/h (19 mph) over short distances.

Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps. Territorial bulls each preside over a stretch of water and a group of five to thirty cows and calves. Mating and birth both occur in the water. During the day, hippos remain cool by staying in water or mud, emerging at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos typically do not display territorial behaviour on land. Hippos are among the most dangerous animals in the world due to their aggressive and unpredictable nature. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory (canine teeth).

<h1 class="populations"> POPULATIONS FACE INCREASED PRESSURE</h1>
<p> 

    Hippopotamuses, the third largest terrestrial mammal, continue to decline due to widespread poaching for meat and ivory from the hippo’s long ivory canine teeth. Meanwhile, human encroachment into hippo habitats have decimated their historic range, and the species have already gone regionally extinct in three African countries. Currently, hippos are confined mostly to protected areas, and over the past 10 years their populations have declined 7-20%. The two types of hippos, the common hippo and the pygmy hippo are listed as Vulnerable and Endangered, respectively.

    <h1 class="margin-3">HIPPOS ONCE ROAMED ALL OF AFRICA

    </h1>
    <p>
        The incredible hippo has been a part of the African ecosystem for millions of years, once ranging from the Nile river valley to the Cape. However, due to illegal and unregulated hunting, retaliatory killings and widespread habitat loss, the remaining 125,000-148,000 common hippos are now confined to protected areas. Of the 29 countries where common hippos are still found, populations are confirmed to be declining in half of those countries.

        There are actually two types of hippo species in Africa, the large hippo, or common hippo are found throughout East Africa’s grasslands and wetlands, and the small, solitary pygmy hippo dwells in West Africa’s forests. Only 2,000-3,000 pygmy hippos likely remain in Africa.

            Hippopotamus is a thick-skinned animal with a huge rotund body on stubby legs and an enormously wide snout. Smooth, purple-brown skin is pink in creases and under-parts. Its feet have 4 webbed toes. It can open mouth very wide. The heaviest land mammal after the elephants, the Hippopotamus feeds by plucking grass with its wide muscular lips. Hippos spend much time underwater, coming ashore to feed at night. They spend the day digesting and socializing in the water. Hippos form dense groups, especially during the dry season when waters recede. Herd members often lie in contact with one another. Males compete for females and their tusks can inflict terrible wounds.
